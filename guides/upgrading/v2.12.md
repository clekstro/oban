# Upgrading to v2.12

This Oban release includes a couple of optional configuration changes to aid in
testing and development.

## Bump Your Deps

Update Oban (and optionally Pro) to the latest versions:

```elixir
[
  {:oban, "~> 2.12"},
  {:oban_pro, "~> 0.11", repo: "oban"}
]
```

## Modify Configuration for Testing

The new `:testing` option automates configuring an Oban instance for testing.
Make the following change to your `test.exs` to opt into `:manual` testing mode:

```diff
# test.exs
- config :my_app, Oban, queues: false, plugins: false
+ config :my_app, Oban, testing: :manual
```

If you'd prefer to run jobs inline as they're inserted, without involving the
database, then you can use `:inline` mode instead:

```elixir
config :my_app, Oban, testing: :inline
```

See the [testing guide](testing.html) to learn more about test configuration.
